Day 28 - JavaScript Constructors
===================

Today we covered constructors (and had Ben Scheirman talk)

Assignment
------------

1. Define a "Car" function that creates car objects
2. On the car object, define a "isLemon" function that returns true if the model
   of the car is a Pacer, Gremlin, or a Hugo
3. When we create a car, I should tell it the model, and year of the car
4. Create an array of Cars, like the following, but with 6 cars (and 3 lemons).
5. Use `_.filter` to console.log the lemon cars


```js
var cars = [];
cars.push(new Car("Corvette", 1969));
cars.push(new Car("Gremlin", 1995));
cars.push(new Car("Tresla", 2005));
```
